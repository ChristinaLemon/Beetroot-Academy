                to <span class="text-underline">their own section</span>. Continue reading for an introduction to the

            <p class="chapter__text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS 
                applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With
                React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as 
                well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using 
                React components: <span class="text-italic">of reusable, nestable code.</span> You can learn 
                more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how 
                components work in React Native.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="chapter3">
            <h2 class="chapter__title">core components</h2>
            <sup class="chapter__sup">Chapter 3</sup>
            <p class="chapter__text">React Native runs on <span class="text-underline">React</span>, a popular open source library for building 
                user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it 
                helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or 
                can serve as a refresher course.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter__text">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
            <p class="chapter__text"><strong>+ components.</strong> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in 
                its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and
                a cafe to work in.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter__text"><strong>+ JSX.</strong> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you 
                write elements inside JavaScript like so:  <span class="text-background">&#60Text&#62Hello, I am 
                your cat!&#60/Text&#62.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="chapter__text">
                The React docs have <span class="text-underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to 
                learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables 
                inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat, <span class="text-background">name</span>, and 
                embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="text-background">&#60Text&#62</span>
            </p>
            <p class="chapter__text">
                <strong>+ props.</strong> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. 
            </p>
            <p class="chapter__text">
                <strong>+ state.</strong> While you can think of props as arguments you use to 
                configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal 
                data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time
                or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components 
                memory!
            </p>
        </section>
        <section class="chapter4">
            <h2 class="chapter__title">handling text input</h2>
            <sup class="chapter__sup">Chapter 4</sup>
            <p class="chapter__text">TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It 
                has an <span class="text-italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to be called every time
                the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function
                to be called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p class="chapter__text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their
                 words into a different language. In this new language, every single
                 word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" 
                 would be translated as "üçï üçï".
